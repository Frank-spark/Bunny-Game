# Bunny Game: A Fun Coding Exercise for Kids üêáü•ï

## Introduction
This project is a simple **Python game** designed as a learning exercise for kids to explore the basics of coding. It uses the `Tkinter` library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and introduces concepts like event handling, random movements, and collision detection.

The game features:
- A bunny controlled by arrow keys üêá
- A carrot that moves randomly to avoid the bunny ü•ï
- A score counter to track how many times the bunny catches the carrot

The goal is to expose kids to coding in a fun and engaging way, while also encouraging them to think creatively and make their own modifications to the game.

## How the Game Works
1. The **bunny** starts at the center of the screen and is controlled using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
2. The **carrot** appears at a random position and moves in random directions every second.
3. If the bunny gets close enough to the carrot, the carrot "gets caught," and the score increases.
4. The carrot then moves to a new random position, and the game continues.

## Code Explanation
### 1. **Game Setup**
The game uses Python's `Tkinter` library to create a window and canvas for the game elements. Here's what happens:
- The **bunny** and **carrot** are represented by images loaded from your computer.
- The **canvas** is a 500x500 white background where the game takes place.

```python
self.canvas = tk.Canvas(root, width=500, height=500, bg='white')
```

### 2. **Controlling the Bunny**
The bunny moves in response to arrow key presses. Each key press updates the bunny's position on the canvas.

```python
self.root.bind("<Up>", self.move_up)
self.root.bind("<Down>", self.move_down)
self.root.bind("<Left>", self.move_left)
self.root.bind("<Right>", self.move_right)
```

The `move_up`, `move_down`, `move_left`, and `move_right` methods update the bunny's position and check for collisions with the carrot.

### 3. **Random Movement of the Carrot**
The carrot moves in a random direction every second using the `move_carrot_randomly` method. The `after` method schedules this action to happen repeatedly.

```python
self.root.after(1000, self.move_carrot_randomly)
```

### 4. **Collision Detection**
When the bunny gets close to the carrot (distance < 20), the `check_collision` method moves the carrot to a new random position and updates the score.

```python
if abs(self.bunny_x - self.carrot_x) < 20 and abs(self.bunny_y - self.carrot_y) < 20:
    self.update_score()
    self.move_carrot()
```

### 5. **Score Counter**
The score starts at 0 and increases by 1 every time the bunny catches the carrot. It is displayed at the top of the game window.

```python
self.score_label = tk.Label(root, text=f"Score: {self.score}", font=("Arial", 16), bg="white")
```

## How to Play
1. Install Python and ensure you have the `Pillow` library installed (for image handling).
2. Save the bunny and carrot images to your computer and update the file paths in the code.
3. Run the code and use the arrow keys to move the bunny.
4. Try to catch the carrot as many times as possible while it moves around.

## Challenge: Make It Your Own!
This game is just the beginning. Here are some ideas for extending and improving the game:
- **Add a Timer**: Limit the time and see how many carrots you can catch before time runs out.
- **Obstacle Course**: Add obstacles that the bunny needs to avoid.
- **Levels**: Increase the carrot's speed as the score goes up to make the game more challenging.
- **Sound Effects**: Play a sound whenever the bunny catches the carrot.
- **Customize Graphics**: Replace the bunny and carrot with your favorite characters.

## Learning Outcomes
By working on this project, kids will:
1. Learn the basics of Python programming.
2. Understand how to create a GUI using `Tkinter`.
3. Explore key coding concepts like event handling, loops, and randomization.
4. Practice debugging and modifying code to see immediate results.
